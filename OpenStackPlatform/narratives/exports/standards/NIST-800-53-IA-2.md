##Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users)

#### Identification and Authentication
'//*
The customer will be responsible for uniquely identifying and
authenticating organizational users. Microsoft Active Directory
is commonly used for this purpose. A successful control response will
need to address the credentials used to identify and authenticate
users, both internal and external if possible.

As an Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 Container Platform administrator, you can use groups to
manage users, change their permissions, and enhance collaboration. Your
organization may have already created user groups and stored them in an
LDAP server, such as Active Directory. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 Container Platform can
sync those LDAP records with internal Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 Container Platform
records, enabling you to manage your groups in one place. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13
Container Platform currently supports group sync with LDAP servers using
three common schemas for defining group membership: RFC 2307, Active
Directory, and augmented Active Directory. For additional information,
refer to “Syncing Groups with LDAP” in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 Installation and
Configuration guide:

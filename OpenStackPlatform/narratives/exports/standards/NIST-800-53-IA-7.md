##Cryptographic Module Authentication

#### Identification and Authentication
'//*
Administrative access to Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 nodes is performed over SSH. To
limit SSH ciphers to those algorithms which are FIPS-approved, update
the following line in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

Ciphers aes128,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr

The Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 Console, which is the web interface to the system,
automatically converts incoming authentication requests to HTTPS.

#### Audit and Accountability

##### a
'Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 logs are generated using the internal system clock by
default. This is non-configurable behavior.'


##### b
'Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 time keeping relies on the time services provided by the
underlying operating system. When running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
the system time is always kept in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and
converted in applications to local time as needed. Local time is the
actual time on your current time zone, taking into account daylight
savings time. 

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 hosts are configured to use UTC by default. To manually
verify this, the timedatectl command may be used:

$ timedatectl set-local-rtc no'

##Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users) | Acceptance of PIV Credentials

#### Identification and Authentication
'//*
Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials are those credentials
issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and
supporting guidance documents. Customers will not be expected to perform
this credential verification for government agencies. A mechanism for
allowing government agencies to perform credential verification in a way
that can be trusted by the customer system is through Active Directory
Federation Services (ADFS).

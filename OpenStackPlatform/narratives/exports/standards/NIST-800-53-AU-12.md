'//*
Customers are required to provide record generation capability for the
events defined in AU-2a at all information system components where audit
capability is available. A successful control response will discuss the
coniguration of all system components to capture the events that were
defined in AU-2.
*/'


##### b
'//*
Customers are required to allow defined personnel or roles to select
which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the
information system. A successful control response will discuss how
audit generation is implemented, and who selects and configures
auditable events on the information system. Approved personnel or
roles are defined in AU-9(4).

Audit rules may be added/removed through modifying the
/etc/audit/audit.rules or applicable file under /etc/audit/rules.d/. It
is recommended that Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 specific audit rules be added to
/etc/audit/rules.d/openshift.rules.

##### c
'//*
Customers are required to generate audit records for the events
defined in AU-2d with the content defined in AU-3. A successful control
response will discuss how audit records are generated, and how they meet
the requirements defined in AU-2 and AU-3.

##Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users) | Network Access to Privileged Accounts

#### Identification and Authentication
'//*
The customer will be responsible for implementing multifactor
authentication for network access to privileged accounts.

A successful control response will need to address all network-
accessible privileged account types and the means by which 
multifactor authentication is enforced for each.

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 provides a plugable authentication architecture that can
utilize 3rd party authentication schemes that include multi-factor
authentication. The authentication subsystem in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 relies on
OAuth 2.0 and any system that can interact with the OAuth token service
over HTTPS can recieve authentication tokens. Typically this is
implemented using Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13s provided RequestHeaderIdentityProvider as
described in Section 12.3.8, Request Header, of the Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 v3.3

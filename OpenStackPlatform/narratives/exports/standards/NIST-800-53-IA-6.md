##Authenticator Feedback

#### Identification and Authentication
'//*
The customer will be responsible for obscuring authentication feedback
during the authentication process for any customer applications. A
successful control response will need to address the various
authentication scenarios that might arise and the mechanism used
to obscure feedback diring each.

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 natively obscures such information. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 cannot be
configured to be out of compliance with this requirement.

        Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        A control response is planned. Engineering
        progress can be tracked via:

        Changes to Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) information flows take effect immediately. It is assumed
        that all information flow modifications have undergone organizational
        approval processes prior to being implemented in Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH).

        Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) cannot protect against authenticated users who were

        Privileged Administrators are defined as authenticated users who
        were given authorization to execute privileged commands on Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH)
        systems (e.g. "sudo access").

        To modify security policies users must first authenticate with
        standard credentials (e.g. username/password or username/key).
        Once authenticated users must elevate privileges to root access
        through usage of "sudo", which will require users to re-authenticate
        themselves.

        were given authorization to execute privileged commands on Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH)
        systems (e.g. "sudo access").

        The default system behavior allows Privileged Administrators
        to (re)configure security policy filters. For example,
        to reflect changes in network security policies, Privileged
        Administrators can dynamically change the allowed network
        ports and protocols that security policy mechanisms (such
        as firewalld) check in accordance with the definitions
        provided by organizations.

        The selection of organization-defined auditable events is not applicable
        to the configuration of Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH).

        However, as supplementary information, RHVH was designed to audit events
        identified in Intelligence Community Standard Number 500-27 (ICS 500-27).
        The following set of auditable events represent a minimal set of events
        suggested to be audited:

            - Authentication Events
              * Logons (Success/Failure)
              * Logoffs (Success/Failure)
            - File & Object Events
              * Create (Success/Failure)
              * Access (Success/Failure)
              * Delete (Success/Failure)
              * Modify (Success/Failure)
              * Permission Modifications (Success/Failure)
              * Ownership Modifications (Success/Failure)
            - User & Group Management Events
              * User add, delete, modify, suspend, lock (Success/Failure)
              * Group/Role add, delete, modify (Success/Failure)
            - Use of Privileged/Special Rights Events
              * Security or audit policy changes (Success/Failure)
              * Configuration Changes (Success/Failure)
            - Admin or root-level access (Success/Failure)
            - Privilege/Role escalation (Success/Failure)
            - Audit and log data access (Success/Failure)
            - System Reboot, Restart & Shutdown (Success/Failure)

        Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts and Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH)
        require a number of ports to be opened to allow network traffic through
        the system firewall. The firewall rules are automatically configured
        by default when adding a new host to the Manager, overwriting any
        pre-existing firewall configuration.

        Documentation on RHVH interconnections is available in the
        Red Hat Virtualization Installation Guide available at:

        https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/

    To ensure the version of Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) deployed
    carries FIPS validations, the following configuration check must
    be enabled:

    - CCE-80657-0: The Installed Operating System is FIPS 140-2 Certified

    - CCE-80658-8: Set kernel parameter crypto.fips_enabled to 1

    - CCE-80359-3: Enable FIPS Mode in GRUB2'

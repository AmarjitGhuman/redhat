        Unique identification and authentication of organizational users
        is deferred to the organizational identity provider (such as
        LDAP, Active Directory, Red Hat SSO, etc). This part of the control
        is not applicable to Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

        To aid system administrators, documentation on
        supported authentication providers can be found in the
        Red Hat Enterprise Linux product documentation:

        The ability to uniquely identify processes acting on behalf of
        organizational users, such as when a user deploys a new
        container image, is provided by correlating system audit logs.

        The customer will be responsible for performing integrity checks at
        customer-specific frequencies and under customer-specified
        circumstances (including frequencies and circumstances specified by
        FedRAMP). A successful control response will need to identify the
        criteria for performing integrity checking, as well as the rationale
        for selecting those criteria.

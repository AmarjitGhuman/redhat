# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. OpenShift Admins) to
#       handle configuration management the lines below can be uncommented:

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2(2):
#       Implimentation of this control varies between customers. Some create
#       a central configuration management system, e.g. Ansible Tower, and
#       information system components (e.g. OpenShift Adminstrators) are
#       expected to create their own playbooks and store them in the
#       centralized service. Other customers delegate this control
#       entirely to system component administrators.
#
#       For base content, CM-2(2) is expected to be handled at the component
#       level. It's best to check this assumption with your customer
#       Program/Project Management Office.

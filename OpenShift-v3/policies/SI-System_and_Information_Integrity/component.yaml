        '<Memory and unauthorized code protection mechanisms are provided in 
        the base operating system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This includes 
        buffer overflow protection, execution of code on a process’ or 
        thread’s stack, modification of a function return address on the 
        process’ or threads stack to jump to previously known processor 
        instructions, and modification of process section other than the 
        segment that holds compile time initialized data and segment holding 
        the mapping of all uninitialized variables. For the runtime instances 
        of binaries, all user-provided applications and their depending 
        libraries that are compiled and linked with the following properties:

        (1) presence of the ELF program header entry of PT_GNU_STACK and the 
        absence of the PF_X bit in the p_flags ELF header flags; 
       
        (2) presence of the ELF program header entry of PT_GNU_RELRO with 
        memory range information covering the following ELF sections: .tdata,
        .preinit_array, .init_array, .fini_array, .ctors, .dtors, .data.rel.ro, 
        .dynamic, .got including .got.plt. The secure state implied with this 
        functionality covers the following aspects where the following list 
        explains the implication of each bullet above:

                a) When exploiting buffer overruns of an application, the 
                   attacker cannot feed code onto the stack and execute it.

                b) When exploiting buffer overruns of an application, the 
                   modify of the return addresses stored on a stack jump to a 
                   previously known code segment is much harder to achieve by 
                   an attacker. Due to the address randomization, any memory 
                   address of code already present with the application or 
                   loaded libraries will be different with each startup of the 
                   application.

                c) The ELF header sections listed above are set read-only using
                   the mprotect system call by the loaded before the application
                   gains control. When exploiting buffer overruns, the attacker 
                   cannot modify information in those memory sections. These 
                   sections store offset tables required for the dynamic linking
                   mechanism and, if abused, allow attackers to modify the jump 
                   addresses of object accesses. Full protection against this 
                   type of attack can only be achieved if the application and
                   all depending shared libraries are compiled linked with full 
                   protection enabled. When at least one shared libraroy the 
                   application depends on or the application itself is compiled 
                   and linked with partial protection, only partial protection 
                   against this type of attack is available for the given 
                   application. 

        To enforce functionality in bullet a), /proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield 
        must contain either a 1 or 2.

        To enforce the functionality in bullet b), 
        /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space must contain a 2 (1 implies the 
        address randomization is enabled except for the brk system call).

        'The selection of organization-defined auditable events is not applicable
        to the configuration of Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH).

        However, as supplementary information, RHVH was designed to audit events
        identified in Intelligence Community Standard Number 500-27 (ICS 500-27).
        The following set of auditable events represent a minimal set of events
        suggested to be audited:

            - Authentication Events
              * Logons (Success/Failure)
              * Logoffs (Success/Failure)
            - File & Object Events
              * Create (Success/Failure)
              * Access (Success/Failure)
              * Delete (Success/Failure)
              * Modify (Success/Failure)
              * Permission Modifications (Success/Failure)
              * Ownership Modifications (Success/Failure)
            - User & Group Management Events
              * User add, delete, modify, suspend, lock (Success/Failure)
              * Group/Role add, delete, modify (Success/Failure)
            - Use of Privileged/Special Rights Events
              * Security or audit policy changes (Success/Failure)
              * Configuration Changes (Success/Failure)
            - Admin or root-level access (Success/Failure)
            - Privilege/Role escalation (Success/Failure)
            - Audit and log data access (Success/Failure)
            - System Reboot, Restart & Shutdown (Success/Failure)'

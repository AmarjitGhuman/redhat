        The customer will be responsible for uniquely identifying and

        is commonly used for this purpose. A successful control response will
        need to address the credentials used to identify and authenticate
        users, both internal and external if possible.

        As an OpenShift Container Platform administrator, you can use groups to
        manage users, change their permissions, and enhance collaboration. Your
        organization may have already created user groups and stored them in an
        LDAP server, such as Active Directory. OpenShift Container Platform can
        sync those LDAP records with internal OpenShift Container Platform
        records, enabling you to manage your groups in one place. OpenShift
        Container Platform currently supports group sync with LDAP servers
        using three common schemas for defining group membership: RFC 2307,
        Active Directory, and augmented Active Directory. For additional
        information, refer to “Syncing Groups with LDAP” in the OpenShift
        Installation and Configuration guide:

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON IA-2(1):
#       Many customers are accepting password-enabled SSH keys as multi-
#       factor authentication. The SSH key (something they have) and the
#       decryption password (something they know). Before enabling CAC and
#       PIV cards, it is recommended to seek guidance from your Program/Project
#       Management Office.

        OpenShift provides a plugable authentication architecture that can

        authentication. The authentication subsystem in OpenShift relies on
        OAuth 2.0 and any system that can interact with the OAuth token service
        over HTTPS can recieve authentication tokens. Typically this is
        implemented using OpenShifts provided RequestHeaderIdentityProvider as
        described in Section 12.3.8, Request Header, of the OpenShift v3.3

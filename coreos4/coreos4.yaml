        AC-1 is an organizational control outside the scope of

        technical controls, such as AC-2 (3) which disables
        inactive accounts.

        CoreOS components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While CoreOS can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, CoreOS does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software.

# AC-2(2) NOTES:
#       The customer will be responsible for automatically removing or
#       disabling emergency and temporary accounts within the required
#       timeframe. A successful control response will need to address
#       all of the procedures and mechanisms involved in disabling these
#       accounts.

        CoreOS end-user account management is inherited from

        To meet FISMA requirements, CoreOS must be configured
        to use centralized authentication (e.g. LDAP, Red Hat IdM,
        Active Directory). The audit of account creation,
        modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions is
        the respinsibility of the centralized service. Additionally,
        notification of organization-defined personnel or roles is
        also the responsibility of the centralized authentication
        service.

        To modify security policies users must first authenticate with

        Once authenticated users must elevate privileges to root access
        through usage of "sudo", which will require users to re-authenticate

        CoreOS utilizes the firewall technology embedded into the

        immediately. This gives an CoreOS operator the ability to immediately
        drop all remote connections.

        Additionally, CoreOS nodes may be placed into Maintenance Mode. This
        designation will migrate applications from a given cluster node to
        another, disconnecting any active sessions to a given cluster node.

        If immediate disconnect of all hosted applications are desired,
        individual containers may be halted. This will disconnect user sessions
        for tenant applications immediately.

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. Red Hat Identity
#       Management Admins) to handle configuration management the

        CoreOS System administrators, regardless of local or remote access,
        have access to command line tools to remove data from CoreOS system
        components. Examples include removing a local file (e.g. through
        the "rm" command) or remotely purging/wiping CoreOS nodes and
        reinstalling them through processes such as Terraform Bare
        Metal (re)installation.

        This capability is an intrinsic property of being a
        CoreOS System Administrator with remote access
        credentials.

## Developers note on SA-4 (1):
##  This control requires that developers of system components, e.g.
##  application servers, to provide a description of the functional
##  properties of the security controls to be deployed.
##
##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD
##  STIG, for the component.
##
##  In absense of an approved government configuration baseline,
##  note this requirement is satisfied by a *description* of
##  functional properties. Implimentation details are offered in
##  SA-4(2).

## Developers note on SA-4 (2):
##  This control differs from SA-4 (1) in that implementation
##  details are now required.
##
##  The majority of FedRAMP and FISMA Moderate systems refine this control
##  with the following:
##    - Provide design and implementation regarding security-relevant
##      external system interfaces and high-level design;
##    - Provide design and implementation information required by the
##      SDL process;
##    - Above should be provided with a level of detail sufficient for
##      secure deployment.

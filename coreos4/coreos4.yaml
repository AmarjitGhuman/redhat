        The NIST National Checklist for CoreOS provides SCAP-formatted
        automation content which could be used in satisfaction of
        CA-2(b), and is interoperable with any NIST SCAP Validated Product
        and Module.

        Additionally, SCAP scanners will generate a compliance report which
        could be used to satisfy CA-2(c).

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. Red Hat Identity
#       Management Admins) to handle configuration management the
#       lines below can be uncommented:

        CoreOS System administrators, regardless of local or remote access,
        have access to command line tools to remove data from CoreOS system
        components. Examples include removing a local file (e.g. through
        the "rm" command) or remotely purging/wiping CoreOS nodes and
        reinstalling them through processes such as Terraform Bare
        Metal (re)installation.

        This capability is an intrinsic property of being a
        CoreOS System Administrator with remote access
        credentials.

## Developers note on SA-4 (1):
##  This control requires that developers of system components, e.g.
##  application servers, to provide a description of the functional
##  properties of the security controls to be deployed.
##
##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD
##  STIG, for the component.
##
##  In absense of an approved government configuration baseline,
##  note this requirement is satisfied by a *description* of
##  functional properties. Implimentation details are offered in
##  SA-4(2).

##
##  The majority of FedRAMP and FISMA Moderate systems refine this control
##  with the following:
##    - Provide design and implementation regarding security-relevant
##      external system interfaces and high-level design;
##    - Provide design and implementation information required by the
##      SDL process;
##    - Above should be provided with a level of detail sufficient for
##      secure deployment.
